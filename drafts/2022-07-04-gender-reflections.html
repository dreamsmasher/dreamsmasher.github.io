  <section>
    <p>I haven’t touched this site in a while.</p>
<p>That’s a lie, I’ve been refactoring the backend a lot and writing a
bunch of draft posts, that never end up being good enough for me to put
on the main section. There are some exciting things in the works but
life has been absolutely hectic.</p>
<p>This post is going to be pretty personal, so be warned if you’re here
for code. There’s talk of mental health, self-harm, depersonalisation,
and trauma.</p>
<hr />
<h3 style="color:yellow">
prelude: a story of some weird kid
</h3>
<p>The last year as a whole has probably been the most eventful solar
rotation of my entire life - I’ve succeeded plenty, failed even more,
and cried more times than I care to admit. I moved to the city, which is
nice. I became a professional software un-fucker-upper, which is even
nicer. Things have moved at a breakneck pace to the point where a whole
year flew by without me even noticing it.</p>
<p>Today’s a pretty special day, for reasons I haven’t really made
public outside of Twitter - exactly 365 days ago, I started
transitioning. That is, I started HRT on July 4, 2021. I was so nervous
at the time that I didn’t even realize it was USA day, but that’s fine.
I’d rather celebrate myself than a theocratic empire I don’t even live
in.</p>
<p>I had inklings about my gender identity my whole life, but always
brushed it away. Even though I grew up in metro Vancouver, my area had
major small-town bumfuck-nowhere vibes, especially in people’s
attitudes. Growing up as a second-generation immigrant in a Chinese
household didn’t help either. There were times when my parents
straight-up asked me if I was trans (in terminology that was not nearly
as nice), but I always denied it. And why wouldn’t I? The idea of
transgender identity being a normal, widespread phenotypic expression in
humans wasn’t a concept I had real exposure to until much later. Trans
people were a caricature in media, a passing joke, a punchline. That
couldn’t be me, I was normal. I couldn’t be a part of that group.</p>
<p>Sure, I was <em>different</em>. I was diagnosed with ADHD in 2019,
and for a while that was the retroactive explanation I gave for all of
those incidents where I felt completely isolated from the people in my
peer groups. Times where I didn’t feel like I belonged with my friends
who were out playing sports and training in martial arts. I just wanted
to sit inside and fuck around on the computer, or fixate on fiction.
Escapism was more enticing than the outside world, because of the
freedom it afforded me. There are no expectations in a book, just the
story and the interpretations that bounce around in your head. Nobody’s
personally interrogating you about your weird mannerisms or your
stimming habits.</p>
<p>Nothing really felt <em>right</em>, or honest for that matter. It
always felt like I had some sort of vague secret that I was hiding from
everybody. What secret? I couldn’t even tell you. But I felt like I had
to walk on eggshells in every interaction, cram myself into a box so my
parents and friends would stop questioning me about it. I should have
pieced it together years ago, honestly. There are many,
<em><code>many</code></em> suppressed memories that have only recently
popped back into my head, memories of sneaking around, of letting out
bits of gender expression away from the watchful eyes of cisnormative
expectations.</p>
<p>When I was 7 (I think?), I remember seeing a guy outside tie their
sweater around their waist. Kid me was <em>ecstatic</em> at this new
knowledge, because it looked like he was wearing a skirt. Yeah. And it
was a <strong>dude</strong> doing this, which meant I could do it too.
Wow, a way for me to look like I was wearing a dress without actually
wearing one. I grabbed this collared shirt and tied it around my hips,
and got way too excited looking at myself in the mirror. I went to bed
wearing that sweater-skirt-thing that night. Nobody questioned me about
it.</p>
<p>This didn’t stop, even after becoming an adult. I was a decade older
and more aware of things, but this didn’t translate to self-awareness. I
cocooned myself in a weird sense of self-righteousness to cope with
things. I was taller, wider, and frankly, abnormally muscular for
somebody that doesn’t work out. I was infallible, far above than
everyone else around me. Why wouldn’t I be? I knew I wasn’t like others,
and the only explanation I could accept was that I was just
<em>better</em>. I had a huge ego and acted like a stuck-up asshole.
Still, I felt like shit all the time. At that point, I had graduated
high school, and that vague sense of unease had graduated into
full-blown guilt.</p>
<p>That’s the best way to put it - I felt guilty. Sure, I kinda liked my
body? Why would I want anything else? I had big arms, and an even bigger
ego. I was proud of who I was, and thankful to my parents for everything
they gave me. Acknowledging discomfort would be spitting on those gifts
and everything they’ve worked for. I didn’t want to bring shame to them,
so I took it all upon myself and locked it away. I felt like a fucking
ogre sometimes, but that’s okay if you’re a dude. I was a fridge, but at
least I <em>owned</em> it.</p>
<p>I now consider this mindset, at least in my case, to be a form of
self-harm. There’s <em>no</em> way I had any femininity, not when I
looked like that. So, the closer I got to this abstract persona, this
meat-puppet male model skinsuit, the further I ran from this
indeterminate unease. It’s self-defeatism in the rawest sense. I was
setting myself up to fail at femme presentation from day one, because to
confront that would be to throw away every piece I thought I knew about
myself. Cliche, I know. I basically stopped trying in terms of clothing
or appearance. It didn’t matter, because guys don’t care.</p>
<p>These thoughts never went away. Clearly, since I have C cups now. If
anything, they came back and hit me worse, the harder I tried to push
them down. It was like trying to knock over a standing punching bag.
Every ounce of force I threw, was reflected back toward me.
Relationships were hard, because I felt like I was lying to every person
I dated. They thought they were with <code>$DEADNAME</code>, the fuccboi
asian chad I liked to think I was. I was incredulous that people would
want to date me at all. What were they seeing that I wasn’t?</p>
<hr />
<h3 style="color:yellow">
if you’re questioning, you probably have your answer already
</h3>
<p>It came to a head in March of 2019. I was laying awake at 3am,
thinking about life. Thinking deeper than usual. Reflecting on where I
was going, all that pseudo-intellectual stuff. Until I thought too deep.
Deep enough to the point where every one of these suppressed memories
hit me all at once, like a fucking truck. I had vaguely associated the
word “trans” with these emotions for years, but never let myself
confront it. Until that point, when I truly asked myself for the first
time in my life, “am I trans?”.</p>
<p>I started panicking, hyperventilating, paralyzed by terror. This was
the first panic attack I ever had, out of complete nowhere. There was no
way. No fucking way. Oh god. Every transphobic wojak drawing, every “man
in a dress” depiction plastered across the internet by bigoted
neckbeards to sow brainworms in the marginalized, those were all me. I
hated myself. I hated this realization. My life was over. My parents
would disown me. Everything I had worked for would come crashing down,
and I would just be another laughingstock. A stubbly creep that people
would cross the street to avoid.</p>
<p>No way. I had to know right then and there whether I was trans or
not. I looked online, for others in the same position. Throwing a
question out to complete strangers that would be better directed inward,
no matter how painful it was to confront.</p>
<p>I called a trans hotline. One for people going through times of
crisis. I felt guilty for using resources like this. I wasn’t part of
their target demographic. I wasn’t self-harming, or actively planning
suicide. But I figured this would be the best place to seek advice, from
somebody who knew more than I did.</p>
<p>Nobody answered.</p>
<p>I was fuming. Not at the organization, but at the situation. What if
I was having an immediate emergency? How many people have been left
hanging during the darkest periods of their lives? (Side note, this is
painfully common among LGBTQ+ helplines due to high call volumes, and
inadequate funding/volunteers. Please consider donating resources and
time if you can, I’ll leave some links in the footnotes.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>)</p>
<p>I was so mad that I stopped panicking altogether, and fell asleep. I
felt drained the next day from everything I had gone through, but when I
woke up, I had my answer.</p>
<hr />
<h3 style="color:yellow">
even if you know, people won’t like it
</h3>
<p>The next few months were spent planning - planning how I would break
this to my girlfriend at the time, to my parents, to my sister, to the
rest of my family, to every friend I had.</p>
<p>I came out to my girlfriend in August, then my parents in September
of that year. Almost half a year after my near-breakdown, I finally
started taking steps toward transition. I called the local community
health clinic to try and get an appointment, and they cited me a wait
time of 8 months. That was unacceptable to me.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> I
called around for a while, and eventually got to the point where I went
to a walk-in clinic to ask in person.</p>
<p>Actually, it was more fucked than that. I had an appointment with an
ADHD clinic, since my usual walk-in physician wanted to confirm my
diagnosis after I moved back from Ontario and started seeing him. I
figured since this was a specialist centre, they would be able to at
least refer me to an endocrinologist. At the end of the appointment, I
told the specialist I was trans, and the first thing she asked me was
“are you crossdressing?”. The way she asked it, her sudden shift in
tone, the ice in her voice after I made my queerness known, made me feel
disgusting. Like she was a psychologist at a correctional institution
dealing with a pervert in stolen lingerie. It’s not about clothes.</p>
<p>My parents had the same reaction. One of the first things my mom said
was, “so you want to wear bras?”. Fuck that. I’m not even wearing one
right now.</p>
<p>I was pissed. So I tried again with my walk-in doctor, and his
reaction was funnier. He said, “oh ok, so you want to do the
transgender?”</p>
<p>Yes Andy, I wanted to do the transgender. That’s literally all I
wanted my entire life.</p>
<p>This was around January of 2021. He referred me to Trans Care BC, and
I had an appointment set with a clinician in a month who specialised in
trans care. She was fantastic. We talked about my history with my gender
identity, whether I had begun any social transition (I hadn’t), and she
gave me a lot of reassurance about the path I was starting to go down. I
was just thankful to finally be dealing with a doctor who actually knows
about this stuff. Another referral to an endocrinologist, and I had my
prescription in hand by March.</p>
<hr />
<h3 style="color:yellow">
the only people who accept it are people who know themselves
</h3>
<p>That’s right, March of 2021. I don’t know why, but I was terrified to
take that last step and actually start the process for real. That little
slip of paper sat in my drawer for 4 months before I decided to stop
being a lazy piece of shit and start living my life. Part of me was
afraid that I would go to the pharmacy to pick it up, and they would
announce it to the entire store, like “Ok Mr. <code>$DEADNAME,</code>
here’s your estrogen!”. They actually did end up doing that, but
whatever. Don’t go to London Drugs.</p>
<p>I made friends with another trans girl around that time, and she
helped give me that final nudge to go fill that prescription. It was
just a simple reassurance and some company at the drugstore, but I’m
eternally thankful to her. I probably would have held it off even longer
if she hadn’t been there.</p>
<p>Hormones didn’t really feel all that different at first. They started
me on a low dose, but I definitely started to see some changes around
2-3 months in. I bought my place in August and moved in, so I was
finally able to switch out my wardrobe and start collecting cute pieces.
Learning how to do makeup felt like a necessity, so I added that to my
endless list of hobbies too.</p>
<p>Makeup is fucking HARD, by the way. At this point I do it like 2-3
times a month max, but I like how I look with or without it. It was an
even bigger hassle at first, because I had this idea in my head that my
femininity was tied to it. I would spend an hour following a video
tutorial, and do a <em>decent</em> job at first. Then I would fuck up
with my eyeliner, and everything would fall apart. I looked in the
mirror and all I saw was a clown. My reflection would shift, and the
person in front of me would morph into that nightmarish figure that I
wanted to avoid. That brainworm caricature of a man in a dress, smeared
eyeliner wings, stubble poking through caked foundation.</p>
<p>This is dysphoria.</p>
<p>Incidents like this put me off of makeup for a few weeks. I reached
out to a transmasc friend who I’ve known for years for advice, since
he’s a literal god at it. I asked him, “How the FUCK do I do makeup?”. I
was crying when I wrote that. What he told me still rings in my head
from time to time - “Makeup is literally coloured paste we apply to look
inhuman”. It made a lot of sense. I was associating a literal consumer
product with my own identity. Playing right into the hands of those
corporate bastards at Maybelline HQ. He told me to try doing it terribly
on purpose, in order to get used to my face at extremes. To silence that
uncanny-valley instinct and look at it from a more objective point to
view. This helped me take makeup a lot less seriously, and start having
fun with the process. I didn’t end up doing anything too wild, since any
look I did would end up terrible anyway. But the reassurance helped me a
lot, in separating the performativity of gender expression from the
integral nature of gender identity.</p>
<p>And yes, he hates doing eyeliner too. I think everybody does.</p>
<p>Transition is a constant learning process. Cis people have the luxury
of time, the blessing of having their awkward learning phases coincide
with an extended phase in their lives where things don’t really matter.
There are no responsibilities to uphold, no professional image to
maintain. No git logs to retroactively update. No established identity
to overwrite. Trans people have to speedrun their second puberty, since
the discomfort of being a beginner is amplified in visiblity. Nobody
notices a cis person. They’re just living their lives. So are we, but
people’s perceptions zoom in on deviations from the norm. You can
present as feminine as you want, but people only notice the stray hairs
on your chin. The bar is set way higher for us, and it’s exhausting at
times. Everybody makes awkward fashion decisions; it’s a learning
process not unlike figuring out a new instrument or sport. But nobody’s
going around taking pictures of bad golfers to share on image boards.
Nobody is pointing fingers at novice guitarists and blaming them for
society’s decline.</p>

<h3 style="color:yellow">
things go downhill
</h3>
<p>They upped my hormone dosage around October of 2021. My levels were
looking good, so it was time to go all-in. My estradiol got tripled to
6mg/day, and my spironolactone got doubled to 200mg/day.</p>
<p>I felt the side-effects of spiro HARD. My brain was basically a pile
of mush for months. It was hard to code, or get anything productive done
at all. That’s partially why this site hasn’t been updated in a
while.</p>
<p>It was around this time that my parents found some of my old hormone
bottles in my old room, and the fallout was BAD. I mentioned that my mom
didn’t have a great reaction when I first came out to them - they
basically asked me at the time to keep my identity a secret from the
rest of the family. This is why I waited so desperately to move out
before starting to present femme full-time. All my fears about making my
parents ashamed basically came true. It didn’t matter to them how I
felt, or that I was probably going to end up killing myself in a few
years if I had to keep living that charade. They were more worried about
how they would come across to everyone. How my queerness made them look
bad. How it reflected poorly on them as parents, for raising a boy so
poorly that he failed as a male entirely.</p>
<p>In between me coming out and that moment, we didn’t talk about
transition once. They probably felt that by ignoring the issue, it would
disappear. That my coming-out to them was on a random impulse, just a
weird, isolated moment.</p>
<pre><code>If you're going to do this, I am going to have to seriously reconsider being your mom.</code></pre>
<p>That text devastated me. Even retyping it here, my heart still sinks
having to recall that moment. This was the lowest point in my
transition. I still wasn’t out at work or to my cis friends, so my only
real support network were other trans people. Even while feeling so
isolated and withdrawn, I still thought I had my family as a safety net
of support if worse came to worst. It was incredibly lonely and
invalidating to basically be disowned. Especially since, all things
given, they should have been proud of where I was. I was making more
than both of them at 23. I was out on my own, independent, driven, and
self-sufficient. Living my own life. I wasn’t doing it for them, of
course. But I had achieved most of my medium-term goals. I was finally
an engineer. I had confronted that nagging unease that plagued every
decision I had made in my life and accepted who I was. I was doing
something I loved, AS somebody I loved. It was a pyrrhic victory.</p>
<p>I had some dark thoughts every once in a while.</p>
<p>Part of me would wonder sometimes, if I were better off dead. If my
family would rather have a dead relative than a gay one. If I was even
good enough to deserve love from others. Whether I deserved happiness
and success.</p>
<p>I still hadn’t picked a name yet. So the identity crisis was
exacerbated by the fact that I didn’t really have an identity. I was
still <code>$DEADNAME</code> to most people in my life, the government,
and the outside world. Things felt gradually more and more insular, like
the walls of my circle of comfort were slowly caving in. Choking me in a
claustrophobic embrace.</p>
<p>Around then, I started seeing someone, and my life started to pick up
a little bit. She was also a trans girl - this was the first queer
relationship I had ever been in, and the sense of community and kinship
was intoxicating. I embraced the idea that I deserved tenderness,
irrespective of who I was. Plus, we were hot. That felt fucking awesome
to acknowledge.</p>
<p>That experience taught me a lot about my sexuality. It was honestly
hard to believe she was trans too. The contrast between our bodies was
stark, demarcated by a year of hormones. I wasn’t jealous, though. I
didn’t give a single fuck about assigned gender at birth, because all I
saw was a creative, sharp, and stunning person. I stopped thinking about
myself in terms of my AGAB too, because the reality of the situation was
obvious. It was a lesbian relationship. T4T dating is incredibly
affirming, and it makes complete sense why trans people are so drawn to
each other. <del>Stand users attract other stand users.</del> The
transition process is deeply personal, and it forces you to face
yourself in the most raw, unfiltered way possible. There is no analogue
for cis people. You have to uproot your entire sense of being, and
cherry-pick the parts that truly matter and make you, <em>you</em>.
Everything else goes into the trash. You’re doing a refactor over a
codebase that has accumulated decades of cruft. It’s only natural to
seek out someone with that shared pain, similar rejections, that same
ability to address themselves in a completely honest manner.</p>
<p>I spent Christmas with her family. I felt like I had found another
safety net to replace the one that I had thrown away by choosing to head
down this path. My parents and I were on bad terms still. That sense of
rejection had turned into resentment, that something as trivial as my
outward appearance could make them lash out so harshly.</p>
<p>We broke up shortly after New Years, and I was right back to where I
was in October. Cut off again from a community. I didn’t talk to anyone
for a while. My routine was the same, day by day. Wake up. Work. Finish
work. Lie down on the couch. Stare at the ceiling. Eat dinner. Sleep.
Goto Wake up.</p>
<p>That continued for a while, that fugue state of self-despair and
non-productivity. I could barely let out a peep, let alone write a line
of code. I thought I had completely lost any drive or sense of purpose.
It wasn’t the breakup that was hurting me, it was the isolation. I felt
like the only person in my own little bubble. At one point I didn’t even
go outside for a few weeks.</p>
<p>I had always thought of myself as a pretty creative person. Somebody
with the drive to express impossibly dense and profound levels of ideas
with little effort. Once, I signed up last-minute to give a presentation
on programming language design to an unfamiliar audience. The night
before the talk, I wrote an interactive Lisp interpreter from scratch
for a demo, the source code of which doubled as my presentation slides.
These 1000 lines, not including my presentation script, took me 3 hours.
I didn’t need to consult any references beyond the data structures I was
using; it all came together naturally. And it worked without a hitch.
This felt great to accomplish at the time.</p>
<p>The person I used to be, carried loads of self-hate. Sure. But I
still knew what I was capable of. I hadn’t reached that state of flow in
half a year, and I thought I had thrown that integral part of myself
away with the rest of my old identity.</p>
<p>I felt useless.</p>
<hr />
<h3 style="color:yellow">
:s/down/up/g
</h3>
<p>It was mid-February now. My mood was weird at this point. I knew that
if I didn’t take charge of things, I would keep slipping. I set a goal
for myself, to gradually start coming out to people. It started with 1
or 2 people per week, and everybody took it well. My sister was the
first person to find out. I was terrified, because of how my parents
reacted. Thank fuck zoomers are more open-minded.</p>
<p>I picked my name around this point. Honestly, I had liked the name
Naomi for years, and I always thought it’d be a nice name for a
daughter. Too bad, I stole it. The gradual rollout of Me 2.0 had started
to accelerate, and eventually I had told every one of my past friends.
People that I didn’t interacted with in ages. People whose potential
reactions were completely opaque to me. I didn’t get a single bad
one.</p>
<p>Sure, there were some stupid questions. I got about 20 of the same
“when did this start?”, and “wow, how did you realize”. I was glad to
answer them, because at least I wasn’t being accosted or berated. They
just wanted to know how to act around me moving forward. They respected
me, even if they didn’t understand. I didn’t lose any more community
from this, thank fuck.</p>
<p>I decided it was time to take that big step, and come out at work.
People were great too. I got a ton of positive reactions and good
sentiments, and it felt great in that moment to finally be present as
myself. The CEO herself chimed in to congratulate me on taking this
step. HR gave me a new email within 5 minutes. I was proud, of both who
I was and that I finally stopped putting this off.</p>
<p>It wasn’t all perfect, though. Before I came out, I changed my
display name on Slack and my avatar too. Most people figured out who the
person behind this mysterious personal speech was, easy enough. All my
usernames on my other work accounts remained the same. We had a company
all-hands that week, and I chimed in at some point. The CEO responded to
me by deadnaming me in rapid succession. She must have said it at least
10 times in a row.</p>
<p>Don’t deadname trans people. Even now, I get really upset seeing it
written or mentioned anywhere.</p>
<p>I guess she didn’t connect the dots between my post and who I was?
Everybody in the meeting froze in shock, HR included. It later turned
out that she thought I was one of the contractors or interns. Shit. I
tried to make my identity as clear as possible, but clearly I didn’t do
enough. That moment ruined my mood for the next little while. She
apologized still.</p>
<p>My productivity was still in the toilet at this point, and not for
any real justifiable reason. My emotional state was at a low point, but
not in any dramatic or painful sense. I felt numb. Maybe deep down, I
saw coming out as a last-hurrah sort of deal. That if I were to do
something drastic, I wanted to be addressed by my proper name at least
once. I wanted to experience ordinary life as myself. Just to know what
it was like. Then I could go happily.</p>
<p>By March, I left my job. Things had gotten to a point where I didn’t
feel that I could continue on. I had failed myself, my coworkers, and
everyone around me. Actually, that third clause is redundant. I was just
on my own now. I didn’t feel like I was good enough for anything or
anyone. I was burnt out from pulling late nights, trying to catch up on
technical debt from earlier nighttime sprints. It was a cycle of stress
and hurt. I dreaded going into work and facing my coworkers, deeply
intelligent people who I respected. Who I let down.</p>
<p>I laid in bed for 2 days straight, only getting up to fulfill minimum
survival needs. My cat had food and water. I had food and water. Nothing
else mattered, really. This felt safe. Nobody would look down on me if I
was hiding under my blankets. I belonged here and here alone.</p>
<p>Being a lazy piece of shit got boring quick, so I willed myself back
out of my room after a while.</p>

addendum: egg.sh
</h3>
<p>If you’ve read this far, I guess I’ll include SOME code in this
essay. During those months I spent at home, waiting for a hormone
readiness assessment, I wrote this shell script as a little reassurance
